Hi there 👋

I'm Frank, a Software Engineering student at **San José State University**

I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I have experience building and deploying web projects, including a personal portfolio website.

Currently, I work as a **Software Engineering Intern at Krowd Guide**, supporting backend and data feature development using **SQL and Python**, and as an **AI Trainer at Handshake AI**, where I evaluate and improve large language model outputs. 

I am also a **Microsoft Student Ambassador** and an **MLT Fellow**, actively developing my technical and leadership skills.

Fluent in Spanish, I bring strong communication skills and enjoy web development, creative projects, and staying active.

Fun Facts:

• Physically active in the Gym 
• Big coffee fan 
• Enjoy learning new skills beyond programming
